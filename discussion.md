# Public Discussion

Public discussion section is available for all the members in the organization. Here the most recent discussions will be available and sorted based on the time published. A searching option is available for the users to filter the topics content wise. When publishing discussions to the public discussion forum the writers should give relevant keywords regarding the content, for better accessing and convenience. Number of votes for a discussion, writers name etc. will be displayed here. Also, users can give their voting for these discussions too. Moreover, for clarifications users can contact the writer personally via chat button.
