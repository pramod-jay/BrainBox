# About

This is a secure and collaborative platform for internal knowledge sharing. Each project is handled on seperate repositories and subdivided onto sections based on topics. Discussions can be contributed by code, knowledge, and solutions, which are ranked by voting. The platform includes a public discussion forum with search functionality and contributor rankings. Chat options facilitate communication, and leaderboards promote active participation. Additionally, high-voted solutions are included in documentations with quizzes for employeeÂ assessment.
