# Leader board

Leader Board of the knowledge repository works as an incentive to the users. It lists down the rankings of the contributors to the discussions. Top rankers will be displayed on top. Rankings will be given based on the voting and reputations of a writer. Reputation is captured based on how many discussions he/she have contributed. Voting is number of recommendations taken for a particular solution of a discussion. Each user can identify their current standing through the lead board. Userâ€™s ranking will be displayed separately for convenience.
